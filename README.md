🚀 Project Title: Liquid Canvas Effect

live link: https://codepen.io/Funny-Vibes-the-typescripter/pen/EaPREWo

🌟 Overview

This project is a dynamic and interactive web application that generates a stunning,

physics-based liquid simulation on an HTML5 canvas. It is designed to be highly responsive and

visually engaging, providing an aesthetic liquid surface effect that reacts to user input. It is built

using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (likely utilizing a library like Liquid.js or custom

canvas logic).

✨ Features

● Dynamic Liquid Simulation: Creates a fluid, physics-based animation within the canvas

element.

● Interactive Response: The liquid surface reacts dynamically to mouse movement or

touch events (disturbing the surface).

● Full-Screen Canvas: The visual effect is optimized for a full-screen, immersive

experience.

● Responsive Design: Uses CSS (style.css) to ensure the canvas scales correctly across

various device sizes and orientations.

️ Installation and Setup

Prerequisites

● Web Browser: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is required to

view the application.

● No server-side dependencies (like Node.js or Python) are strictly required, as this is a

client-side application.

Step-by-Step Guide

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [Your Repository URL]

cd [Your Project Folder Name]

2. Install dependencies: For client-side apps, this step is often just ensuring all files are

present.

# No package installation required.

3. Run the application: Since this is a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, you can run it directly

in your browser.

○ Locate the index.html file in the cloned folder.

○ Double-click on the file, or right-click and select "Open with..." a web browser.

The application will open immediately without needing a local server.

🚀 Usage

Basic Interaction

The application runs immediately upon opening index.html.

1. Move your mouse cursor over the canvas area.

2. Watch the liquid surface ripple and react to your input, simulating water or another fluid.

3. The core logic for rendering and physics is managed by script.js.
